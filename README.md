# EDA-Swiggy-in-Metro-Cities


This repository seeks to document Exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Swiggy Dataset of restuarents in metro cities like Kolkata, Mumbai, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Delhi, Hyderabad, Bangalore, Pune and Surat.

Dataset is taken from kaggle : "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aniruddhapa/swiggy-restaurants-dataset-of-metro-cities"

The code imports necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, geopy, and folium. It also imports Image and HTML libraries for displaying images.

After importing the required libraries, the code suggests that data has been cleaned, which means that the data has been pre-processed and is ready for analysis.

The analysis aims to explore the restaurant scene in major metropolitan cities like Kolkata, Mumbai, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Delhi, Hyderabad, Bangalore, Pune, and Surat. This suggests that the analysis could involve exploring restaurant data such as cuisine types, customer ratings, restaurant locations, and more, for the mentioned cities.

Overall, the code sets up the necessary environment and libraries for analyzing restaurant data in various metropolitan cities, which can provide useful insights for individuals and businesses involved in the food industry.
